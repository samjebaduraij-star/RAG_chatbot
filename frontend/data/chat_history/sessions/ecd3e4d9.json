This enhances data privacy, security, and cost-effectiveness (Source 1, Source 2).\n*   **User Interface:** It uses a web-based UI built with Streamlit, which allows for real-time queries, model switching, and visualization of responses (Source 1, Source 3).\n*   **Technology Stack:** The system uses Ollama AI and Langchain for response generation (Source 2).\n*   **Contextual Awareness:** To improve response accuracy, the system converts user queries into vector embeddings. It then uses a cosine similarity search to retrieve relevant past interactions from a database, providing contextual awareness for the AI (Source 2, Source 3).\n*   **Accessibility:** The server can be accessed via a mobile hotspot or Wi-Fi network without needing additional networking infrastructure (Source 2).",
